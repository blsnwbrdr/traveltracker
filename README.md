# Travel Tracker

Count and map the countries you have travelled to using this app. It uses the Google Maps API to generate the map, place markers, and create marker clusters. The buttons are generated by looping through an array of country information. The app can also generate a map to share with others using some PHP, AJAX, and JSON.
